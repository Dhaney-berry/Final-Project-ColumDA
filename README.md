# Final-Project-ColumDA # Ames Housing Data Machine Learning Engineering and Exploration

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the Ames Iowa Housing dataset, applying data engineering techniques to clean, transform, and explore the data. The primary objectives include:

- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Feature engineering for improved model performance
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns

The dataset consists of various features related to residential homes in Ames, Iowa, such as:
- *Sale Price*: The target variable for predictive modeling
- *Lot and Property Features*: Lot size, shape, frontage, and zoning
- *Building Characteristics*: Year built, dwelling type, roof style, and overall quality
- *Room Features*: Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and basement specifications
- *Neighborhood Information*: Location-based attributes impacting housing prices

## Data Engineering Process
1. *Data Loading*: Importing data from the source file into a structured format using pandas.
2. *Cleaning and Handling Missing Values*:
   - Identified and filled missing values based on logical imputations.
   - Converted categorical variables to numerical where applicable.
3. *Feature Engineering*:
   - Created new features such as total square footage and price per square foot.
   - Encoded categorical variables using appropriate transformation techniques.
4. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*:
   - Generated visualizations to understand distribution, correlations, and patterns.
   - Identified outliers and potential influential factors in housing prices.

## Key Findings
- Certain features like *Overall Quality, Living Area, and Basement Size* strongly correlate with sale prices.
- Neighborhood location significantly impacts housing prices.
- Engineered features such as *Total Square Footage* improve model predictions.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- *Python*: Primary language for data processing
- *Pandas & NumPy*: Data wrangling and numerical computations
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn*: Data visualization
- *Scikit-learn*: Feature transformation and modeling
